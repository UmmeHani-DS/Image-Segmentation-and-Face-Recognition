# Image-Segmentation-and-Face-Recognition
This project involves implementing interactive foreground segmentation using K-Means clustering and face recognition using a k-NN classifier. It includes tasks such as image segmentation with Lazy Snapping, and face recognition on the CMU PIE dataset using k-NN, SVM, and GaussianNB classifiers.
